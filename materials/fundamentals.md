## Setting up

### Prepare as participant

To participate in this course, you need a standard Drupal installation, preferably one Drupal site per person. Your trainer may provide a hosted Drupal site for you. If you know how to install Drupal, check the Drupal installation section below.

### Prepare as trainer

Attendees need a working Drupal 8 site to perform the exercises. You as a trainer need one too to demonstrate Drupal and explain and demonstrate the exercises.

The trainer is advised to use a personal sandbox on a localhost server. For attendees there are roughly two options: On-line and provided by the trainer or Self hosted by the attendee on a localhost server. The choice depends on the attendee's ability, or their company's, to install Drupal.

### Drupal installation

Use the latest stable Drupal release. Use the opendrupal_drupal_fundamentals installation profile that is included, and copy it into the profiles directory. Install Drupal with this installation profile. The profile can be found in the set-up directory of this course.
