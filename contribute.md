## Contribute to Open Drupal
The Drupal project is constantly evolving and course materials should be kept up to date. We welcome your contribution to Open Drupal.

All materials are maintained at [github.com/opendrupal](https://github.com/OpenDrupal/). Each course front page and readme contains a link to its repository. Feel free to fork and contribute your improvements and extensions.

## How can you help?

  - Maybe you have training materials you could add to our library?
  - Perhaps you could translate some of the existing materials into other languages?
  - Have you got ideas for any practice challenges or projects?

## Get in Touch
You can always reach the community via the [OpenDrupal channel in Drupal Slack](https://drupalslack.herokuapp.com).
